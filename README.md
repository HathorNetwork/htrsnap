# HathorSnap

This project is a fork of BitcoinSnap [![0.3.1](https://badge.fury.io/js/btcsnap.png)](https://badge.fury.io/js/btcsnap)

*Note: MetaMask Flask is an experimental playground for developers and is not to be confused with the normal [MetaMask wallet app](https://metamask.io/).

##

### MetaMask Snaps Introduction
Snaps is a system that allows developers to safely build and expand the capabilities of MetaMask. It is a program that is run in an isolated environment with a limited set of capabilities, that can customize and modify MetaMask's wallet experience for end users. For example, a snap can add new APIs to MetaMask thus adding support for different blockchains or modify existing functionalities using internal APIs.

Additional information can be found [here](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html).
